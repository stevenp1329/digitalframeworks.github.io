## Police kept on their toes by big-name media outlets, schools, non-profits.

A mere handful of news outlets, universities and nonprofit organizations have kept the Chicago Police Board on its toes in recent years with Freedom of Information Act requests. Data <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/FOIA/FOIA-Request-Log-Chicago-Police-Board/9pd8-s9t4">published</a> by the city indicate the the nine-member civilian body that oversees certain Chicago police operations, including disciplinary proceedings in cases of alleged misconduct, has received 288 requests since May 2010. That works out to an average of about one FOIA request per week.

A total of 172 different people submitted requests to the board, but a few repeat-requesters stand out. Tracy Siska, executive director of the Chicago Justice Project, made 22 requests during the given time frame, more than anyone else in the sample. That's not terribly surprising, given <a href="http://chicagojustice.org/about">the Project's stated mission</a> of striving "to access and analyze data from criminal justice agencies to promote evidence based reforms that will better serve the justice needs of local communities." Chicago Tribune reporter Jeremy Gorner came in second, with 17 requests.

Skimming these data for notable names is interesting, but I've been obsessing lately over how individuals relate to the organizations they comprise, so I decided to use pivot tables to count the 86 unique organizations listed in the FOIA request log. (More than a quarter of the requests had no organization listed.) The Chicago Tribune came out on top with 33 requests; second-place finisher Chicago Sun-Times had 25, and the Chicago Justice Project fell to third with 22.
